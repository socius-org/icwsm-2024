# Unleashing 🔓 Data for Global Impact 🌍

### Data is the new oil 📈 powering our world. From stats and maps 📍 to real-time sensors 📶 and experiment results 🔬, effectively collecting, managing and sharing data has become critical.

As our societies run on data to drive decisions and insights, we need a robust global data infrastructure to: 
🌳 Combat climate change
📝 Support evidence-based policies  
📵 Fight online exploitation & disinfo
👥 Confront societal polarization

Building this global infrastructure is no easy feat though. It requires coordinating across:
🗺️ Borders
🏭 Sectors  
🔬 Disciplines
👨‍💻 Technical standards
📜 Legal regimes

Aligning all those stakeholders with different goals & systems is a complex challenge. The OpenDataInstitute's #GlobalDataInfrastructure investigates how **researchers can break down barriers and unlock cross-boundary collaboration for research tackling global challenges**.
