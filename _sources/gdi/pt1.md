#### Data is the **new oil 📈 powering our world**. From stats and maps 📍 to real-time sensors 📶 and experiment results 🔬, **responsibly collecting, managing and sharing data** has become critical.

As our societies run on data to drive decisions and insights, we need a robust global data infrastructure to: 
* **🌳** Combat climate change
* **📝** Support evidence-based policies  
* **📵** Fight online exploitation & disinfo
* **👥** Confront societal polarization

Building this global infrastructure is no easy task though. It requires coordinating across:
* **🗺️** Borders
* **🏭** Sectors  
* **🔬** Disciplines
* **👨‍💻** Technical standards
* **📜** Legal regimes

Aligning all those stakeholders with different goals & systems is a complex challenge. The OpenDataInstitute's [#GlobalDataInfrastructure](https://theodi.org/insights/projects/global-data-infrastructure/) investigates how **researchers can break down barriers and unlock cross-boundary collaboration for research tackling global challenges**.
