# Ethical Considerations 

## Unleashing the ethical avalanche 🔭, such as research integrity, informed consent, and anonymity when harnessing Reddit data. 

## 🧠 Research Integrity 

Academic research involving human subjects demands adherence to ethical principles like informed consent, opt-outs, and the "do no harm" mantra. Yet, IRBs clash over whether public social media data constitutes human subject research <sup>[[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20563051211019004)], </sup><sup>[[2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1556264617725200)], </sup><sup>[[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053951716650211)], </sup><sup>[[4](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2818048.2820078)]</sup>. 

## 📝 Informed Consent

While [Reddit's User Agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement) grants broad rights, it doesn't cover third-party research use. Researchers should (ideally) obtain explicit user consent before using public Reddit content, upholding ethical standards. But what about [Hawthorne Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect)? 

## 🕵️‍♀️ Anonymity

Scraping certain Reddit forums could expose highly sensitive personal data, requiring controlled access and anonymisation. Although Reddit deems public information accessible, users often expect privacy and anonymity. Researchers must anonymise user data and preserve user privacy with unwavering commitment.
