# Key Focus Areas

The Open Data Institute is at the forefront of building a robust global data infrastructure to fuel high-impact research. In our mission to develop a truly global data infrastructure, we've compiled essential readings exploring crucial topics. 

## 💼 Enabling Access to Privately Held Data
How can we responsibly open up access to data troves currently siloed within private entities? This data could fuel public-interest research tackling global challenges through [private-public partnerships](https://www.data4sdgs.org/initiatives/unlocking-privately-held-data-public-good), [legislation](https://www.eu-data-act.com/), [safe data institutions](https://icebreakerone.org/open-net-zero/), or [privacy-enhancing tech](https://socialscience.one/our-facebook-partnership).

## 📡 Connecting Datasets Across Borders  
Datasets from different regions and organizations remain scattered. We'll explore creating networks to [connect research data globally](https://www.labmanager.com/global-natural-history-initiative-builds-groundbreaking-database-30028), clarifying [provenance](https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-ai), and facilitating [cross-disciplinary sharing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4547313/) - like linking museum collections for climate studies.

## 🔗 Bridging Academic and Industry Research
Too often, a divide separates academic findings from the private/public sectors. We aim to enable knowledge-sharing across these domains through [citation standards](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-022-04398-3), identifiers, schemas, and search platforms.

## 🔐 Unleashing Findings Behind Paywalls
Paywalled research restricts access and transparency. Our efforts support [open science](https://goingdigital.oecd.org/data/notes/No13_ToolkitNote_OpenScience.pdf), [open access](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3760666/), [transparent licensing](https://dataprovenance.org/), and [free platforms](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2018/10/28/unpaywall-a-beautiful-way-to-help-everyone-get-the-research/) as alternatives.

## 🧑‍🌾 Filling Data Gaps for Inclusive Innovation  
Gaps in key datasets can leave communities underrepresented. We'll back projects ensuring language, [demographic](https://www.worldpop.org/), and other vital datasets are comprehensive and representative globally.
