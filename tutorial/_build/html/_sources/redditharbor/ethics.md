# Ethical Considerations 

#### Unleashing the ethical avalanche, such as research integrity, informed consent, and anonymity when harnessing Reddit data. 

**🧠 Research Integrity**: 
- Academic research involving human subjects demands adherence to ethical principles like informed consent, opt-outs, and the "do no harm" mantra. 
- Yet, IRBs clash over whether public social media data constitutes human subject research. 

**📝 Informed Consent**: 
- While Reddit's User Agreement grants broad rights, it doesn't cover third-party research use. 
- Researchers should (ideally) obtain explicit user consent before using public Reddit content, upholding ethical standards. But what about Hawthorne Effect? 

**🕵️‍♀️ Anonymity**: 
- Scraping certain Reddit forums could expose highly sensitive personal data, requiring controlled access and anonymisation. 
- Although Reddit deems public information accessible, users often expect privacy and anonymity. 
- Researchers must anonymise user data and preserve user privacy with unwavering commitment.
