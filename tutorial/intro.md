# Welcome 

Welcome to [the 18th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media](https://icwsm.org/2024/index.html/)! 

We're thrilled to present our tutorial **Scraping Reddit the Right Way: A Guide to Legal and Ethical Data Collection with RedditHarbor**. This tutorial is co-organized by socius and the Open Data Institute, featuring:

- [Nick Oh](https://nick-sh-oh.github.io/), Principal Researcher at socius  
- [Sasha Moriniere](https://theodi.org/profile/sasha-moriniere/), Researcher at the Open Data Institute
- [Jared Keller](https://theodi.org/profile/jared-robert-keller/), Head of Research at the Open Data Institute

The tutorial has three parts. First, we'll introduce the ODI's Global Data Infrastructure typology, providing a big picture view of platform data access - from APIs to data trusts and more. Next, we'll focus specifically on Reddit, discussing how to collect and use Reddit data ethically and legally. Finally, we'll provide hands-on training for RedditHarbor, a scraping toolkit designed to streamline Reddit data collection seamlessly. 

We hope you find this tutorial to be a valuable learning experience! To promote open science, this documentation is intended as an ongoing reference for both ICWSM 2024 attendees and researchers who couldn't make it this year. Please reach out to research@socius.org with any questions or feedback. We're happy to help fellow computational social scientists continue ethical and legal Reddit research even after the conference.
