# Best Practises 

## During this part of the tutorial, we will discuss some of the best practises üó∫Ô∏è when working with Reddit data, from being cautious with vulnerable subreddit communities to properly handling user-deleted content in an ethical manner.

However, this section is meant to be an engaging discussion with all participants. During the tutorial, please feel free to share your own insights, challenges, concerns, dilemmas or success stories related to working with online data platforms like Reddit.

Your personal experiences and perspectives are valuable contributions to this conversation. Whether you've faced ethical issues, navigated complex platform policies, or found effective solutions, we want to hear about it.

This is an opportunity for an open dialogue, where we can learn from each other's approaches and collectively develop a better understanding of the responsible use of social media data for research purposes.


<!-- **Exercising Caution with Vulnerable Populations** üö®
If delving into psychological research, exercise heightened caution. Scrutinize subreddit rules, as some carry explicit warnings about direct data collection. For instance, mental health support communities mandate moderator approval for research posts/surveys. While these subreddits may not explicitly prohibit collecting submissions and comments, participants are inherently vulnerable, necessitating robust ethical safeguards. Researchers should judiciously weigh potential benefits against risks of utilizing such sensitive data, emphasizing informed consent, confidentiality, and community sensitivities. Consider transparently advising moderators on data usage plans to uphold ethical standards. With conscientious precautions around ethics and privacy, select analyses may still responsibly further understanding. (The Grey Area of Informed Consent)

**Leveraging Approved APIs and Privacy-Focused Tools** üîë
Secure an approved API from Reddit, and ensure data collection adheres to ethical and privacy-safe practices. Leverage RedditHarbor ‚Äì a tool meticulously designed to navigate the grey areas of data scraping and user privacy.

**Responsible Publication and Attribution** üìù
While publishing research results is permissible, disseminating the data itself or any derivative products based on Reddit data (e.g., models trained using Reddit data) is prohibited. Proper attribution to Reddit (and any third-party tools utilized) is mandatory, coupled with stringent anonymization of information in published findings. Additionally, provide Reddit (reddit.research@reddit.com) with a copy of your research, allowing reasonable advance notice before publication.

**Handling User-Deleted Content Ethically** ‚åõ
When users delete their posts or accounts, it's advisable to respect their implicit revocation of consent by removing any stored copies of their data from your research databases. This upholds user privacy expectations and ethical research practices.

**Robust Anonymization and Access Controls** üîí
Implement stringent anonymization techniques and access controls to protect any sensitive personal data collected from Reddit forums. Consider techniques like data aggregation, pseudonymization, and restricted access protocols.

**Longitudinal Research Justification** üî≠
For longitudinal studies involving retention of user-deleted data, clearly articulate the overriding societal benefits and scientific merit. Ensure robust anonymization, data minimization, and limited access controls to justify this exceptional use case.

**Transparency and Community Engagement** ü§ù
Foster transparency by openly communicating your research intentions, data handling practices, and privacy safeguards. Consider engaging with relevant Reddit communities to build trust and address potential concerns. -->
